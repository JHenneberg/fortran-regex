# Fortran Regex

Regex is the necessary tool for text processing. As a Fortran programmer, text
processing is occasional, but exists. When it happens, we can only rely on our
own hands to count which characters need to be changed. This is very behind the
times! So I decided to implement a regex engine in pure Fortran to fill this
pit.
